# How is the tool updated
There's a big spreadsheet with information concerning all the nauts. The spreadsheet can be uploaded to the live version through https://orikaru.net/pages/games/awesomenauts/nautsbuilder-import.php but you will need a special permission to access the page.
If you are interested in updating the data for the tool you can join https://discord.gg/GsE29w7 and ask around

# Do you have any plan to release the code of the API
