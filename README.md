# NautsBuilder V2
Live link: https://orikaru.net/nautsbuilder

Create builds for the game Awesomenauts in this web-application. Data are stored in a API that can be updated by members of the community.

This tool is based on the first version that can be found here https://github.com/Leimi/nautsbuilder and was created because the first one was outdated.

This tool has been made from scratch but it uses the same spreadsheet as NautsBuilder V1

# How is the tool updated
There's a big spreadsheet with information concerning all the nauts. The spreadsheet can be uploaded to the live version through https://orikaru.net/pages/games/awesomenauts/nautsbuilder-import.php but you will need a special permission to access the page.
If you are interested in updating the data for the tool you can join https://discord.gg/GsE29w7 and ask around

# Do you have any plan to release the code of the API
No because it's just a static API. The page linked above will just update its content.
